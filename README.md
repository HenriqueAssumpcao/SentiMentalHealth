PyTorch implementation of our GRU-based RNN for predicting user emotional tone in online mental disorder communities.

## Introduction

This repository provides the original implementation of the "Predicting User Emotional Tone in Mental Disorder Online Communities". The paper was published in the [FGCS Special Issue on Sentiment Analysis Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/future-generation-computer-systems/call-for-papers/special-issue-on-senti-mental-health-future-generation-senti). The paper can also be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).
The chosen model for extracting the sentiment features from reddit posts and comments was the [VADER Sentiment Analysis Tool](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment).

## Contents and Usage

This repository contains four python notebooks, each accomplishing a specific part of the proposed pipeline. We highlight that all the notebooks are already configured for enabling users to reproduce the paper's results. 

* The [REDDIT_SCRAPPER]() notebook downloads the data from a given subreddit using reddit's API. 
* The [PRE_PROCESSING](PRE_PROCESSING.ipynb) notebook transforms the data into a single dataframe containing all the information needed for training(VADER's scores, relevant statistics about the threads, etc.)
* The [PAPER_RESULTS](PAPER_RESULTS.ipynb) notebook performs the actual training of the model and the analysis of the results.
* The [REVIEW_EXPERIEMENTS](REVIEW_EXPERIMENTS.ipynb) notebook is an extra part of the pipeline, that performs confidence interval experiments and other relevant but not essential studies for the model.

The [Source](src) folder contains the .py files with useful functions and, most importantly, the Pytorch implementation of the model itself. A command-line version of the model will be available in the future, but currently only the used notebooks are available.
